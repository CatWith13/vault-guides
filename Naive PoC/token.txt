WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: PK7fBQbVHpkBi9xR+mOUQIP7d5Q7Yqv+rqJr00rvaMA=
Root Token: s.6O0WiC0z2mM2e9eumHKhLhIA

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
